## Step 1: Emergency fund

An emergency fund is an amount of money kept somewhere liquid (accessible) in a way that it can be accessed at any time, such as a savings account<sup>\*</sup>. This money is meant to cover unexpected expenses such as loss of work, car / appliance repairs, etc.

Should you ever use part of your emergency fund, you must come back to this step and replenish it before going back to any further steps.

**ProTip**: Consider local banks such as BDO/BPI/Metrobank/Security Bank. Banks that are easily accessible, and with branches that are open on weekends. It's also a plus if they have a ₱30,000 - 40,000 ATM withdrawal limit (for easier access).

### How much money to have in an emergency fund

The usual recommendation for most people is 3 to 6 months of expenses. If your income is variable or uncertain, it may be worth having a bigger fund such as 9 to 12 months of expenses.

Having a budgeting app or a budgeting spreadsheet will help here, especially one's with reports/trends. Refer to [_budgeting_](/budgeting/creating-and-managing-your-budget/).

### Repaying high interest debt

If you are currently repaying high interest (for example above 10% interest) debt, you should start with a smaller emergency fund of 1 or 2 months of expenses (or ₱ 25,000 w/e is higher) while you pay down the high interest debt.

### Where should I put my emergency fund

Emergency funds should be put in safe, liquid accounts such as savings accounts. The goal is for the fund to never decrease in value and to be able to retrieve the money very quickly should the need arise.

They should **not** be put in any type of investment as this could result in losses or even in the impossibility to get the money out quickly. As well, **a credit card should not be considered an emergency fund** because of the high interest.
