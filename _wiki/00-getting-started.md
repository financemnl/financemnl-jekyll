Hi there. If we haven’t met, we're **[FinanceMNL](/about)**. We're glad that you came here.

## We understand the struggle; we’ve been there.

FinanceMNL has everything you need to know about money, written by real people who’ve been there.

If you’re in over your head, we can help!

Maybe you’re here because after you pay rent, buy food/groceries, and giving your share, you struggle to save anything at the end of the month.

Maybe you think you should start building credit—but you’re afraid to apply for a credit card.

Regardless of what brought you here, you’re in the right place. And you’re not alone. Young people are struggling right now, and mostly for reasons outside their control. We’re here to help you take back some of that control.

## How can we help you?

Alright, so we can’t wipe out your debt, but we can show you the best ways to pay it off or how to use credit cards wisely so you don’t get n debt in the first place.

We can’t increase declining incomes, but we can help you ask for a raise, start a lucrative side hustle and build habits that invite success.


We can also help you make smarter choices when it comes to buying decisions like buying products that are durable, practical, proven and made-to-last.
