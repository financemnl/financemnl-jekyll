## Step 2: Employer-sponsored matching funds

If your employer offers matching in a retirement account/provident fund, contribute the amount needed to get the full employer match, nothing more. As this is essentially free money, it's important to take advantage of it.

### What if my employer doesn't match, or I don't have an employer-sponsored plan?

Skip step 2, move to [step 3](/wiki/pay-high-interest-debt/).

### What if my employer contributes to an account on my behalf regardless of whether I contribute or not?

You are very fortunate. Make sure you are getting the match (usually 15% of pre-tax income).

### What if I am self-employed

If you are self-employed, you can also make your own contributions to [PERA (Personal Equity and Retirement Fund)](), but you should do this as part of [Step 5](/wiki/save-for-retirement/).
