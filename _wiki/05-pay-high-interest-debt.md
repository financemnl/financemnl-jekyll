## Step 3: Pay down high interest debt

After you ensure you're taking advantage of your employer match, you should use your extra money to pay down your high interest debt (e.g., debts much over 4% interest rate).

In all cases, you should make the minimum payments on all of your debts before paying down specific debts more quickly.

## There are two main methods of paying down debt:

### The **avalanche method**

Debts are paid down in order of interest rate, starting with the debt that carries the highest interest rate.

This is the financially optimal method of paying down debt, and you will pay less money overall compared to the snowball method.

### The **snowball method**,

Popularized by Dave Ramsey, debts are paid down in order of balance size, starting with the smallest.

Paying off small debts first may give you a psychological boost and improve one's cash flow situation, as paid off debts free up minimum payments. The downside is that larger loans (that may be at higher interest rates) are left untouched for longer, costing more in the long run.

### What's the best method?

Most personal financial forum tend to favor the avalanche method, but do not underestimate the psychological side of debt payments.

If you think that the psychological boost from paying off a smaller debt sooner will help you stay the course, do it!

You can always switch things up later. The important thing is to start paying your debts as soon as you can, and to keep paying them until they're gone.
