Section:

1. Foreword (The usual rule of thumb is 3 to 6 months' income. Of course that's silly--the size of your emergency fund needs to be based on your spending, not your income. But even 3 to 6 months' spending is an arbitrary figure. Here's a few tips on sizing your emergency fund.)
2. Do you need an emergency fund? (We certainly think you do, but there are those who have different ideas. state yung mga tao na invest muna nasa isip)
3. Para saan? / Pupose (The basic purpose of an emergency fund is to tide you over if you lose your job. Because money is fungible, the same emergency fund can cover other financial gaps--unexpected expenses, or the unexpected loss of non-job income. It's there to give you some time to make the necessary adjustments when a gap develops between income and expenses--either get your income back up or cut your expenses down to match whatever income you can manage.)
4. How much??  (Reference)
5. How many months?
6. Where to keep? (link dito yung wiki ulit [https://financemnl.com/wiki/emergency-fund/#where-should-i-put-my-emergency-fund](https://financemnl.com/wiki/emergency-fund/#where-should-i-put-my-emergency-fund "https://financemnl.com/wiki/emergency-fund/#where-should-i-put-my-emergency-fund") )

References:

The basic factor in the calculation is one month's _minimum expenses._

If you don't have a budget, make a list of:

* **Minimum monthly bills** This is basically all your bills that are either necessary to live, or that you are contractually obligated to pay: rent or mortgage, utilities, car payment, other debt payments, etc. Depending on contract terms, you may have monthly bills that could be canceled on a month's notice or less--cable TV, fitness club membership, and so on. If you _would_ cancel these in the event of a short-term financial crises, you can leave them off the list. Otherwise, include them.
* **Routine monthly expense** This includes groceries, gas for the car, cost of prescriptions beyond what insurance covers, etc. You can take a minimalist approach here--assume you'll be eating lots of rice and beans--but be realistic.
* **Job-hunting expenses** Be sure to include all the expenses that you'd need to support a job search--your phone bill, internet access, enough money for gas (or bus tokens) to get to job interviews, dry cleaning for interview clothing, etc.
* **Other mandatory expenses** This would be tuition, taxes, insurance payments (monthly share for annual expenses), etc.

Add that up. That should give you your rock-bottom expenses for one month.
